# Unreel - N-Back Cognitive Training

**Your brain wasn't built for reels. Train it back.**

Unreel is a dual n-back cognitive training app designed to counteract the measurable cognitive damage caused by short-form video consumption. The science is clear on both sides: reels degrade your working memory, and n-back training is the most evidence-backed method to rebuild it.

## The Problem: Short-Form Video Is Degrading Your Brain

### The Scale

The average person now spends **95 minutes per day** watching short-form video. U.S. teenagers average 87 minutes daily on TikTok alone, and Gen Z averages 112 minutes. 60% of teens visit TikTok daily, with 16% reporting they're on it "almost constantly" (Pew Research, 2024).

### What the Research Shows

A 2025 meta-analysis across **98,299 participants and 71 studies** found that short-form video use is associated with:

- **Attention deficits** (r = -0.38, a moderate-to-strong effect)
- **Impaired inhibitory control** (r = -0.41, the strongest cognitive association)
- **Overall cognitive impairment** (r = -0.34)

These effects were consistent across age groups and platforms -- TikTok, Reels, and Shorts all produce the same damage (Nguyen, Walters, Paul et al., *Psychological Bulletin*, 2025).

### Your Memory Is the First Casualty

An experiment at CHI 2023 had participants use TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, or simply rest during a 10-minute break in a memory task. The results:

- **Pre-TikTok accuracy: 80%**
- **Post-TikTok accuracy: 49%**

TikTok was the **only platform** that significantly degraded prospective memory. Twitter, YouTube, and resting did not produce similar effects. The rapid context-switching inherent to short-form video was identified as the key mechanism (Chiossi, Haliburton et al., CHI 2023).

### It Changes Your Brain Structure

Neuroimaging studies have found measurable physical changes in the brains of heavy short-form video users:

- **Reduced functional activation** in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during cognitive tasks -- the regions responsible for executive control and decision-making (Gao et al., *NeuroImage*, 2025)
- **Reduced theta power** in the prefrontal cortex, the neural oscillation underlying attention and cognitive control (r = -0.395; Yan et al., *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 2024)
- **Structural gray matter changes** in reward-processing regions, with gene expression patterns particularly prominent in adolescent brains (Gao et al., 2025)

### The Dopamine Trap

Short-form feeds operate on **variable reward schedules** -- the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. Each swipe releases dopamine; the unpredictability of content quality generates reward prediction errors that sustain dopamine activity more than predictable rewards would.

Over time, this causes **dopamine receptor downregulation**: the brain produces fewer receptors in response to constant stimulation, leading to tolerance and reduced sensitivity to natural rewards (Sharpe & Spooner, *Journal of Public Health*, 2025).

fMRI studies confirm that platforms like TikTok activate the **mesolimbic dopamine system** -- the same neural pathway involved in substance addiction.

### It Makes You Think Shallower

An experimental study found that watching short videos predicted less analytic thinking and a reduced ability to override flawed intuitions. The **swiping gesture itself**, independent of content, negatively influenced analytic thinking by shifting users toward fast, automatic (System 1) processing at the expense of slow, deliberate (System 2) reasoning (Ma & Jiang, *Cyberpsychology*, 2024).

### It Gets Worse Over Time

An 18-day field experiment manipulating daily viewing habits found that increased short-form video consumption led to progressively higher self-reported attentional lapses and more errors on sustained attention tasks (Lin et al., CHI 2024). A study of 1,016 college students found that higher daily short-form video usage was associated with increased depression, concurrent declines in prospective memory, and lower academic performance (Xia et al., 2023).

## The Solution: Dual N-Back Training

### What Is Dual N-Back?

The dual n-back task requires you to simultaneously track multiple stimulus streams (position, color, shape, sound, number) and identify when any stimulus matches what appeared **n trials ago**. As you improve, n increases, demanding more of your working memory.

### The Foundational Discovery

In 2008, Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, and Perrig published a landmark study in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* demonstrating that dual n-back training could improve **fluid intelligence** -- the ability to reason and solve novel problems, independent of prior knowledge.

- 70 participants trained on dual n-back for 8 to 19 sessions
- Fluid intelligence gains were **dose-dependent**: more training produced larger improvements
- Participants who completed 19 sessions solved an additional **4.4 matrix reasoning problems** on post-tests
- This was the first demonstration that working memory training could transfer to general intelligence

### The Evidence for IQ Gains

A 2015 meta-analysis of 20 studies estimated that n-back training produces gains of approximately **3-4 IQ points** on standardized tests (Au et al., *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*, 2015). A second-order meta-analysis in 2024 confirmed a small but statistically significant overall effect (SMD = 0.335, p < .001).

**Important context on the debate:** The magnitude of IQ gains depends on study design. Studies using passive control groups show medium-large effects (~0.5 SD). Studies using active control groups show smaller effects. This is an active area of research and debate, and the scientific community has not reached full consensus on the size of far-transfer effects.

### What Is Well-Established

Regardless of the IQ transfer debate, the following findings are robust and replicated:

**Working memory improvement:** N-back training reliably improves working memory capacity, with medium effect sizes on near-transfer tasks. Some studies report up to **30% improvement** in working memory measures (Soveri et al., *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*, 2017).

**Neural efficiency:** Brain imaging shows that n-back training produces **decreased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex**, interpreted as increased neural efficiency -- the brain doing more with less. These neural changes persist at least 5 weeks after training ends (Miro-Padilla et al., 2018).

**Striatal plasticity:** Changes in striatal activation are linked to whether individuals show transfer to untrained tasks, suggesting the training induces genuine neuroplasticity in dopamine-related brain areas (*Journal of Neuroscience*, 2016).

**Durability:** A 2011 PNAS study found that intelligence gains remained intact at **3-month follow-up** for participants who showed substantial improvement during training (Jaeggi et al., 2011).

### How Much Training You Need

Based on the research literature:

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Minimum sessions** | 12 (no significant effects at 8 sessions) |
| **Optimal protocol** | 20 sessions over 4-5 weeks |
| **Session length** | 15-25 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 3-5 sessions per week |
| **Type** | Adaptive dual n-back (difficulty adjusts to performance) |

Three sessions per week has been shown to be more effective than two. Consistency matters more than marathon sessions.

### N-Back vs. Other Brain Training

N-back training has the **strongest evidence base** of any cognitive training paradigm:

- **Lumosity** was sued by the FTC in 2016 for unsupported cognitive improvement claims. Its improvements did not transfer to global measures of intelligence.
- **CogMed** meta-analyses found near-zero effects on far-transfer measures of cognitive ability.
- **Dual n-back** showed **superior transfer effects** compared to Method of Loci training in a 2021 study (*Scientific Reports*).

### Directly Counteracting Reel Damage

The mechanisms of n-back training directly oppose the cognitive damage from short-form video:

| Reel Damage | N-Back Countermeasure |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Reduced prefrontal cortex activation | Strengthens prefrontal-parietal network |
| Dopamine receptor downregulation | Induces striatal plasticity in dopamine areas |
| Shift to shallow System 1 thinking | Demands sustained System 2 engagement |
| Fragmented attention from context-switching | Requires continuous multi-stream monitoring |
| Impaired inhibitory control (r = -0.41) | Trains response inhibition on every trial |
| Degraded prospective memory | Exercises working memory updating directly |

## How Unreel Works

Unreel implements an adaptive dual n-back task with five simultaneous stimulus streams:

| Key | Stimulus |
|-----|----------|
| A | Position |
| S | Color |
| D | Shape |
| J | Number |
| L | Audio |

The difficulty (n-level) adapts based on your performance. XP, streaks, achievements, and daily challenges keep you coming back for the 20+ sessions the research says you need.
